# OOP-Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

This is the 'Module 10' challenge assignment for the UCF coding bootcamp.

We were tasked with creating a Team Profile Generator from scratch that would allow us to add team members and display their details in a browser. This project gave us practice with working with Object Oriented Programming, such as working with classes and subclasses.
